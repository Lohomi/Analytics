Hereby lies various insights as well as Visualizations of the Models

- We can see that the dataset we had in the above example had only a signle independent variable, which is rarely the case when you do any   hands on project/work, let us have a look at a Linear Mode that incorporates these multiple independent variables (check: MultLin.py)
  - **What is Dummy Variable Trap?**
  > The [Dummy Variable](https://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html) trap is a scenario in which the independent variables are multicollinear - a scenario in which two or more        variables are highly correlated; in simple terms one variable can be predicted from the others. 
## Polynomial Linear Regression
First let us see how our simple linear model fits the data:
